Using
-----

This branch of the wave-client-for-emacs project uses a direct
connection to the same backend that the http://wave.google.com UI
uses.  Because of this, we have access to all the wave instances,
without having to wait for a client/server protocol or real
federation.

Both the UI and the backend are a work in progress.  Expect this to be
read-only for the near future.

To start using, set your load-path to point to this lisp directory for
this project, and require the wave-list, which is the entry point for
viewing waves.

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/wave-client-for-emacs/lisp")
(require 'wave-list)

Then configure your username:

(setq wave-client-user "mylogin")

And now you can start viewing your waves:

(wave-list-mode)

That will connect you to the default wave instance (wave.google.com).
To connect to a specific domain, such as sandbox, add this line as well:

(setq wave-client-domain "wavesandbox.com")

WARNING: This project currently utilizes the unpublished client/server
protocol that wave.google.com's javascript uses to communicate with
the wave servers. This is not a stable protocol supported by
Google. This protocol is the Google Wave team's internal protocol and
is under active development, so it may change at any time without
regards for this or any other client.


Known issues

Blips are not shown in the same order as in the UI.
