Using
-----

This branch of the wave-client-for-emacs project uses a direct
connection to the same backend that the http://wave.google.com UI
uses.  Because of this, we have access to all the wave instances,
without having to wait for a client/server protocol or real
federation.

Both the UI and the backend are a work in progress.  Expect this to be
read-only for the near future.

To start using, set your load-path to point to this lisp directory for
this project, and require the wave-list, which is the entry point for
viewing waves.

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/wave-client-for-emacs/lisp")
(require 'wave-list)

Then configure your username:

(setq wave-client-user "mylogin")

And now you can start viewing your waves:

(wave-list-mode)

That will connect you to the default wave instance (wave.google.com).
To connect to a specific domain, such as sandbox, add this line as well:

(setq wave-client-domain "wavesandbox.com")

Known issues
------------

We are not fixing up the JSON properly.  Instead of patching it up
with regular expressions, we should change certain json.el functions
to handle the kind of JSON that the Wave server returns.

Delete blips are shown.

Blips are not shown in the same order as in the UI.
